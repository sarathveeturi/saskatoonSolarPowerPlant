  <p align=center>The map is a binary raster map of the south east part of Saskatchewan province. The data sets considered for this map are:<br>
  1.Settlement<br> 
  2.Road<br>
  3.Water<br>
  4.Wetlands<br>
  All the datasets are obtained from <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data"> Open Data Portal, Canada.</a> 
  From Spatial analyst tool in Arctoolbox, the reclassify function is applied on the overlay of all the above mentioned datasets.
  i.e. a raster land use map of settlement(residential) lands, road network maps, water bodies and wet lands of different kinds is taken and classified as un-useful
  areas. These areas are given a value of 0 in the raster cell and are represented in black color. All the remaining areas are given a value of 1 in the reclassification function
  and are represented in white color. Hence, the final output map containing 0 and 1 raster cell values is reffered as a binary raster. All the areas with 0 raster cell value(black color)
  are unsuitable for establishing a Solar farm and all the areas with 1 raster cell value(white color)
  can be suitable for establishing a Solar farm.
