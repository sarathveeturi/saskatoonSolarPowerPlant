  <p align=center>The map represents the slope map of the region of study. The slope value is denoted in percentage units. As the percentage value increases the slope of the terrain also 
  increases. The data is downloaded from <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data">Open Data Portal, Canada.</a> The maximum slope of the study area is 394.6 percent.
  Most of the studies on Solar farm site suitability mapping, have considered that the ideal slope is less than 3-5%. The lower slope value indicates that the area is mostly
  suitable for solar farms in regards to terrain being flat.
