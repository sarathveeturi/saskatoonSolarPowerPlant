  <p align=center>The map is a solar radiation map representing the solar radiation received in the region of study in watt hours per square meter (WH/m2). The datasets used for generating this map are
   1.building footprint dataset of the area of study <br>
   2.digital surface model with a spatial resolution of 0.75 arc/second <br>
   <br>
	All the data sets are obtained from <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data">Open Data Portal, Canada.</a> The area of the region of study is 50,505sq kms in NAD1983 CSRS UTM Zone 13N projection.
	The radiation outputs include both direct and diffuse radiation rasters, as well as a global radiation raster. This global radiation raster calculates the total amount of incoming solar insolation for 
	each location of the input surface by adding diffuse and direct insolation  (Scott Mackey, 2017)(ESRI, 2016). The Area solar radiation function is present in Solar Radiation 
	tool inside Spatial analyst tools of the Arctoolbox. The digital surface model and the building footprint shape file are given as input parameters. All the remaining parameteres like
	Sky size, transmitivity, albedo coefficient are given the default values only. The area solar radiation tool can generate the maps in monthly intervals and average the results to obtain
	an yearly product or it can generate yearly solar radiation product directly.i.e the tools derives incoming solar radiation from a raster surface an analyst determined time frame.
	In this study the time frame considered for Solar radiation map is from 2018 January 1st to 2018 December 31st. The final product is taken as one of the variables 
	to identify the suitable site for solar farm.
