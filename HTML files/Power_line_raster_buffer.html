  <p align=center>The map represents the power lines in the area of study.The data is downloaded from <a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data">Open Data Portal, Canada.</a>
  The power line data is convereted from vector into a raster with a cell size of 30 meters to match the spatial resolution of the rest of the data. proximity to hydro lines
  can reduce the construction and maintenance costs of solar  farms,  and  thus will  be  favourably  scored  in  the  AHP.  The  hydro  lines  raster  was buffered into four classes.
