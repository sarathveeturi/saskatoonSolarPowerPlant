  <p align=center>The map represents the road network in the area of study. 
  The data set is obtained from <a href="https://mapcruzin.com/free-canada-saskatchewan-arcgis-maps-shapefiles.html"> Map Cruzin for Saskatchewan arcgis shapefiles </a>
  The data set is in a vector form which is converted into raster with a 30 meter cell size to match the spatial resolution of the rest of the data for the convinience. The data contains information about different types of raods classified as primary roads
  secondary roads, highways, streets, paths, trails etc. The layer was queried to only include primary and trunk roads.The roads raster was buffered into five classes as shown in the above map legend.
