	<h5 align="center">About</h5>
	<p align="center"> Canada is one of the leading countries in using the renewable energy sources. Hydroelectricity is the mostly used renewable energy resource in Canada.
	Although the scope for Solar power is more efficient than that of Hydroelectric power the usage of hydroelectric power has been in practice since many years.
	In recent studies it is found that many areas in the southern part of Canada are very much suitable for solar power generation.There are many geographic requirements for establishing a solar power plant.
	However a typical solar power plant requires minimum of 15 hectares of land with around 30% of the entire area being covered by upto 20,000 solar panels (Scott Mackey et al, 2017)
	Many researches are made to find out the suitable site for solar farms across the world(Suh and Brownson,2016, Uyan, 2013,Jones et al,2014, Mahtta et al, 2014).
	All these studies considered several variables and integrated them into GIS and used multi-criteria evaluation method to identify the suitable and unsuitable locations for solar farm construction.
	For this study, the analysis is done by integrating various variables into GIS and following the multi-criteria analysis method.The final results gave the suitable sites in south eastern part of Saskatchewan province for establishing solar farms.

	<h6 align= "center">Source @Energyhub.org\solar energy</h6>
	<p align="center">The above image shows the most suitable and efficient areas in Canada with best solar power generated in terms of watt hours per square meter.</p>
	<p align="center">From the study made by <a href="https://energyhub.org/solar-energy-maps-canada/">Energyhub.org</a> it is evident that the southern part of the Saskatchwen province and Alberta province are areas receiving most solar radiation which implicates<br> that a construction of solar power plant in these regions can be effective and efficient.So this study is made on the south eastern part of Saskatchwen province to find the most suitable area or site for establishing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power">solar power plant.</a><br>
	  Hence the south eastern part of Saskatchewan is considered for this study.</p>

	<p align="center">Area of study </p>
	
	<h4 align="center">Datasets used for the analysis</h4>
	<p align="center">For identifying the suitable site for solar farm the datasets are grouped into two variables. In this study the variables are classified as: <br>
	1.Non-modifiable variables<br>
		*Residential areas <br>
		*Water bodies<br>
		*Wet lands<br>
		*Roads<br>
		
	2.Weighted variables<br>
		*Solar radiation<br>
		*Slope<br>
		*Land use<br>
		*Distance from electric power lines<br>
		*Distance from roads<br>
	</p>
	<h4>Non-modifiable variables:</h4>
	
	<p align="center">Non-modifiable variables are the areas or regions with zero probability for construction of a solar farm i.e.
	these areas should be completely neglected while constructing a solar farm.Non-modifiable variables are the regions which should be 
	excluded from a suitable site from establishing a solar power plant because these variables contain more population density and the 
	geographic conditions of the land is unfit for construction of a solar power plant. Considering these variables a raster map of the area of study 
	which is in a binary raster format is generated as shown below.

	to know the description of the above binary map created using the non-modifiable variables</p> 

	<h4>Weighted variables:</h4>
	<p align="center">Weighted variables are the areas which have to be considered and constrained before building a solar farm.
	Each weighted variable will have it's own effect on the site selection for solar farm. An Analytical Hierarchial Process is employed in this study to obtain weightages to 
	the variables and an overlay analysis is performed on the reclassified raster outputs depending upon the weightage values obtained from the AHP algorithm. 
	Depending upon the weightage of a particular type of variable the most suitable site for solar farm is generated. Weighted variables include the following datasets of Saskatchwen:<br>
	
		The below maps are created by considering the weighted variables.

	<p align="center">All the above maps are reclassified inorder to obtain similar values to compare and obtain the weightages.By looking at the legends of above maps  
	it is clear that that the values are not comparable because they are not in a similar type. For this reason, the Raster reclassify function present in 3D analyst tool
    of the Arctoolbox is used and all the values of different are brought into a single digit comparable values. These reclassified raster layers are then put into analytical
	hierarchianl process to obtain weightage values for each variable. Based on the values of the weightages, weighted overlay analysis (Arctoolbox > Spatial Analyst tool > Overlay 
	analysis > Weighted Overlay) is performed as the final step to identify the suitable solar farm sites in the area of study.

	<p align="center"> The following tables give the value of the weightages obtained from AHP. AHP takes the reclassified images and the pair wise comparison matrix
	as the inputs. The values of the pairwaise matrix are given in the table below. The final step of AHP pairwise comparison is to calculate a consistency ratio (CR). This is done  to  
	identify  the  degree  of  consistency in  assigning  values  to  the  variables  in  the pairwise  comparison  matrix  (Suh  and  Brownson,  2016). 
	The formula to get the consistency ratio is CR= CI/RI where CI is consistency index and RI is Random consistency index(Scott Mackey, 2017). The consistency ratio
	in this study (without solar radiation maps) is 0.017. The consistency ratios with a value
	less than 0.10 are considered satisfactory (Carri√≥n et al., 2008)

	<h5 align="center"> Overlay Analysis of the reclassified rasters</h5>
	<p>
	All the products obtained from the non-modifiable variables and weighted variables are put in Analytical Hierarchial process to get the weightage of different layers. The weightages
	
	Once the weightages are obtained the values are used for the Weighted overlay analysis in Spatial analyst tools in ArcToolbox. In the weighted overlay analysis each layer is 
	given a weightage depending upon the importance or the site suitability. All the non-modifiable variables are given a value of 0 and are assigned a black color. The next weightage
	is given from 1 to 9 with a decreasing order of the site suitability i.e. the areas which are most suitable for solar farm hosting are given a rank of 1 and as the rank increases the
	suitability of the land decreases. In this way the output result showing the areas of the Saskatchewan province which are suitable for solar power plant site establishment are 
	obtained.
	<h2 align="center">Results</h2>	
	The map below shows the areas which are suitable for hosting a solar power plant in the south east part of Saskatchwen province which is obtained by using analytical hierarchial 
	process and weighted overlay analysis.

	<h2 align="center">Future development to converge the solar farm into rooftop solar panels</h2>
	The establishment of solar farm or solar power plant can take a lot of time to complete and come into action completely. So, in order to overcome this problem rooftop solar panels
	are the best solution. The idea of rooftop solar panels is that, every building roftop is fixed with a small sized photo voltaic solar panel which can absorb most of the sunlight.
	The panel on each building's rooftop stores the energy in a battery and is used for generation of electicity for the whole building. Rooftop solar panels are much cost effective
	and efficient in terms of power generated and power received. In order to know the amount of electricity generated from each roof top, the point solar radiation tool in the ArcToolbox
	is used. The input parameters are the building footprints and the digital surface model for the area. Each building is considered as a point and the raster cell value generated in the 
	solar radiation map gives the amount of electricity generated in kilo watt hour from one solar roof top panel.
